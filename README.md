# ReducedConfigurationsGenerator-Redacted-version-
Redacted version. All comments removed as well as anything that could violate my NDA or expose company IP. This program parsed multiple excel sheets and performed logic to create Device Under Test Configs. It also checked formatting. 

The orginal configurations generator was able to correctly generate all the nessasary configurations. Because I was leaving my boss worried the program might break and people would be left unable to make configurations on their own if they relied on the program. Thus I reduced it to only make it partially correct configurations as a refrence. I did not save the original.

I cannot be more descriptive due to NDA.

This program is Novus Labs IP.
