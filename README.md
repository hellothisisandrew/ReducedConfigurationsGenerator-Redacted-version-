# ReducedConfigurationsGenerator-Redacted-version-
Redacted version. All comments removed as well as anything that could violate my NDA or expose company methods/IP/Codenames. This program parsed multiple excel sheets and performed logic to create Device Under Test Configs. It also checked formatting. 

Senstive strings were removed and marked "*-----*" 

The orginal configurations generator was able to correctly generate all the nessasary configurations. Because I was leaving my boss worried the program might break and people would be left unable to make configurations on their own if they relied on the program. Thus I reduced it to only make it incomplete configurations as a refrence. I did not save the original.



I was given permmision to post this.
